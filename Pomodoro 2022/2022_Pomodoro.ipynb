    "## Purpose \n",
    "I've got a csv file with multiple years of information on how I spend time working on tasks and projects. This is a notebook that is going to clean up the file I have for all my pomodoro tasks. Previously I've done this cleaning in google sheets. I'd like to clean this up with pandas since I'm leaning Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "This is my personal data, I use an app called BeFocused Pro which is a timer set for 25 minutes, a user can assign this timer to specific tasks. It's what I use when I work on projects, school assignments, work tasks, just about for everything. It's a method that I use to stay focused on a task. The data consists of time stamps and includes information from the 2017 to present day.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import pandas and use the *read.csv* to read the csv with all of my data\n",
    "2. Review the columns present in my data with `data.columns` & then use `data.describe()` to review the characteristics of the numeric fields\n",
    "3. Remove duplicates that may be present here with `data.drop_duplicates(inplace = True)` will drop and save it to the current data, otherwise it would create a new data\n",
    "4. Remove any nulls that may be present with `data.isnull().any()` -- the `.any()` will check to see for each column if there are any null values at all\n",
